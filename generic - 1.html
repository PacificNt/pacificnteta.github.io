												<h3>Microsfot Excel</h3>
											
										
						
												<p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">As mentionned ealier, the project started by importing pdf bank statemts into Excel. This was done by querying the needed data from the pdf bank statement into Excel. A copy of one of the bank statements to see how the bank statements looked and have an idea of which data were excluded and which ones were queried into Excel can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPtUB5XnUcUu6Ww4U4KzSvJ2HFccWM-7/view?usp=sharing" ><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
												
												
												<p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;"> After querying the needed data to Excel, I then did an initial cleaning by transforming the data before loading it using Power Query. With Power Query, I removed empty columns created when querying the data from pdf to Excel, I merged some columns, changed some data types and replace values such as 'null' by '0'. After transforming and loading the data, I did some more cleaning by replacing the year '2024' in the 'date' column by '2023' as in the initial tables from the pdf files, there was no year so Power Query assumed that it was '2024'.  I repeated these steps for all the 8 bank statements from June 2023 to January 2024; I only kept the year '2024' for the January bank statement. In the last step, I combined all the tables/bank statements into one named 'June_to_January' by appending the tables.</p>

											<p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">The pre-cleaned 'June_to_January' table as well as the individual tables for each month can be accessed <a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgZHajPDAbckhi3ZeZvMGgIx8KvO?e=YoZnxM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" ><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

												<h3>SQL Server</h3>
											
										
						
												<p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">After pre-cleaning the data in Excel, I imported the data in SQL Server to further clean it before working with it. I started by checking if the table was perfectly imported and checked errors on which to resume the data cleaning. And after that I aslo checked the data types of all the columns to see where conversion will be applicable.</p>
                                                <a href="images/Financial Insights Project - Table Check.png"  class="image main"><img src="images/Financial Insights Project - Table Check.png" alt="" /></a>
                                                <a href="images/Financial Insights Project - Data Type Check.png"  class="image main"><img src="images/Financial Insights Project - Data Type Check.png" alt="" /></a>


											<p>The following points/errors were noticed : </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The presence of letters <b>('Cr')</b> in the columns 'Amount' and 'Balance'. These two columns are supposed to contain numbers only, the presence of 'Cr' will not make calculations on these columns possible.</li>
                                                <li>The presence of commas <b>(',')</b> in instead of full stops('.') to delimit decimals in the 'Amount' column. This will also make calculations in this column. These two issues will be addressed later.</li>
                                                <li>The columns 'Amount' and 'Balance' are <b>NVARCHAR</b> which is a strong data type but it should be a number data type. And the 'Date' column apprears as 'datetime' but since the time part doesn't reflect any info, we can keep it just as 'date'. These will be fixed later.</li>
                                              </ul>

                                             
                                            


                                              <p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">After noticing the problems mentionned above, I then proceeded to address them. I started by removing the commas ',' as decimal delimiters and replaced them with full stops '.'. After this I proceeded to change data type of the 'Date' column from <b>"datetime"</b> to <b>"date"</b>. After this, I cleaned the 'Description' column by removing '[image]' that was present in some rows.</p>

                                              <p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">After doing the first part of cleaning, I added new columns : Columns <b>'Amount_Clean'</b> and <b>'Balance_Clean'</b> to contain cleaned version of columns 'Amount' and 'Balance', and columns <b>'TransactionType'</b>, <b>'Category'</b> and <b>Subcategory</b> to categorize the transactions. And I then proceeded to set conditions to add values in the created columns and check if the values were addeed correctly.</p>

                                              <p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">In the final step of the cleaning process, I created a table <b></b>'BankStatement'</b> to contain only the needed and clean columns. I first created the new table with its columns and specified data types and then inserted the needed columns from the 'JuneToJanuary' column. </p>
                                             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                              <p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">With the final step of the cleaning process done, I then proceeded to delve deeper into the data by diving into expense and income tracking. I explore metrics such as contribution percentage for all debit and credit transactions, debit and credit categories and subcategories contribution, highest, lowest and average spending on debit subcategories, highest and lowest credit registered, highest, lowest and average balance, and many more metrics.</p>
                                             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                                <li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">+/- 83%(or R30100) of incoming money in the account from June 2023(the 15th) to January 2024(the 15th) came from ATM Cash Deposit, while only 5%(R1884) came from the savings account. The remaining contribution(~11% or R4148.44) is classified as other. But since it represent a good 11% of the total contribution, it is also important to have a closer look at it and find out, what it represents.</li>
                                                <li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">The category'Other' in the credit transactions contains transactions such as payment/transfer received from other Bank accounts as well as an Inward Swift which represent a money transfer from a foreign bank account.</li>
                                                <li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">The highest Cash deposited on the account is R7100 and it was deposited on the 20th of November 2023 and as per the description it is referred to as 'Laptop Money'.</li>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">Around 81%(or R28294.16) of the money that went out of the account(debit) in the period covered in this table(15 June 2023 to 15 January 2024) went to 'Purchases & Payments', 7%(or R2530.83) went into savings, around 6%(or R1940.00) went to E-Wallets, around 3%(or R1250.00) went to ATM Withdrawals and around 2%(R828.00) went to Banking fees. The remaining contribution(0.2%0=) is classified as 'Other'.</li>
                                                <li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">The biggest contribution(around 32% of total) in the 'Purchases & Payments'(which accounts around 81% of all debit transactions) category is classified as 'Other'(We will have a closer look at it after). The second biggest contribution is 'Tuition Fees' which accounts around 31% of total contribution or R8860. And around R2062(or around 7%) was spent on 'Airtime' which is quite close to the amount spent on 'Groceries & Toiletries'(R2384.92 or around 8%). We can aslo hihlights 'Ride Services' wich accounts around 1% of total 'Purchase & Payments'. It is important to note here the the amount on 'Ride Services' doest not really reflect the reality as this reflects only rides that we paid with the Bank card; the rides paid in cash are not reflected here.</li>

												<h3>POWER BI</h3>
											
										
						
												<p style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">After tracking expenses and income into the account, I then connected the 'BankStatement' table to PowerBi for visualuzations. In PowerBi, I started by calculating new measures using DAX : 'Total Amount Credit' and 'Total Amount Debit'. After that, I proceeded to create the report by creating a dummy report first to use as a reference to create a bakcgroung image in PowerPoint and then came back to do the actual report in PowerBi.

												<h3>ACTIONS TO TAKE</h3>
						

						<ul>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;"><strong>1.Multiply or diversify source of income.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;"> As seen during the analysis, the account holder relies heavily on 'ATM Cash Deposit'(accounting around 83% of income). This also increases the banking fees with amount being deposited every month. Finding another source of income will help the account holder not only to not rely heavily on 'ATM Cash Deposit' but also reduce banking fees on ATM Cash deposit.</li>
						<ul>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;"><strong>2.Budget.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">Budget Expenses</li>
						<ul>
                                                      <li>Many economist suggest to have 50/30/20 or 50/40/10 budget plan refering to 50% of income going to the savings, 30% or 40% going to the needs and 20% or 10% going to the wants. In the case of the account holder, around 81% of his spending goes to 'Purchases and Payments' which are not all needs. 81% way beyond the needs. The accout holder should make a list of his needs and wants to allocate only 30 to 40% to his needs and 10 to 20% of its to his wants. The rest should go to the savings</li>
                                                      <li>The expense budget should go down as far as to the subcategories. Based on the behavioral and the average spendngs, the account holder should allocate a specific budget(amount) to subcategories such as 'Airtime' or 'Groceries & Toileries'. The spending on these two subcategories are pretty close; the spending on 'Airtime' should be reduced and budgeted.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">Budget savings</li>
						</ul>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">As said above, around 50 % of income should go to the savings but unfortunately for the account holder, only 7% goes to the savings. The account holder should review his spendings and reduce it so that 50% of the income should go to the savings.</li>
						<u>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;"><strong>3.Manage Balance Fluctuations.</strong></li>
						</u>
						<li style="text-align:left; margin:0; padding:0;">There is a huge difference between the highest and the lowest balance and this inconsistency is seen throughout the whole period. By applying the measures mentionned above and being financially disciplined, the account holder can keep the balance consistent.</li>
